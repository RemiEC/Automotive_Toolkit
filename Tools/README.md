In this folder you have the script we used to install most of the tools
and an additional one that you have execute if you want to install the rest of them.

Therefore, to install the rest of the tools, please execute the following command : 
"source ./additional_tools"

Most of the tools will be installed automatically when launching the script, 
but some require manual steps which you can see in the script in comments.
