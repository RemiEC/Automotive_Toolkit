## Information

Unfortunately, the ISO file is too big for GitHub. However, you can find all the knowledge to create your own ISO. Then, you will easily be able to use it to create a Virtual Machine, using VMWare for example, by selecting Ubuntu64 from Linux when choosing the OS. 

NB : You need at least 30Go if you want to add persistance to your Virtual Machine.

## Important

In the "Tools" folder, you will find another README file which you can read if you want to know what this folder contains.

NB : On the toolkit, you can find it in "/opt".
