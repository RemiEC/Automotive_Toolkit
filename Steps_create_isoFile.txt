Go into the folder you want (I suggest you go into /etc)

Download the file here on your VM backbox : sudo wget https://sourceforge.net/projects/pinguy-os/files/ISO_Builder/pinguybuilder-menu-based_5.2-1_all.deb

Then you have to install a package : yes | sudo apt-get install gdebi

Then do the following command : yes | sudo gdebi pinguybuilder-menu-based_5.2-1_all.deb

We can now access the needed program for creating the ISO file by going into applications and search for « pinguy ». We will see some programs beginning by numbers and in our case, the most interesting ones are : 
	•	2a. Backup (backup-mode) —> Creates an ISO file of the complete system including user data
	•	2b. Backup (dist-mode) —> Creates an ISO file of the complete system without user data
